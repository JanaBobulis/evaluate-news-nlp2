Step 1. 
I set up the project and have installed all the loaders as instructed.

Step 2. 
The API was set using MeaningCloud. I've signed up with MeaningCloud and have got my API credentials. After declaring them in the server/index.js file and filling .env file accordingly I've created Post and Get requests in client and server side. 

Step 3. 
The next step was setting Jest and making tests. Although I read articles and watched videos, it was still not very clear how I implement Jest with my project. Therefore the tests are very basic. 

Step 4. 
Service workers were installed for the website to be available once stopping local server. 

Step 5. 
I've deployed my finished project with Heroku. Although at first it seems very easy, unfortunately that was not the case. I believe so far it's one of the most challenging parts in this project. I tried to deploy my project using GitHub, which worked however there's still no get/post requests.
